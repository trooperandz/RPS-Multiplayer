RPS - Multiplayer Notes

* Dashboard style

* Left sidebar displays player stock img, player name, win & loss count

* Main container displays 2 rows:
   1) 3 main containers
	- Left: 2 phases (Player name + move options (r,p,s)), then move options are replaced with move chosen
	- Middle: battle winner (name)
	- Right: same as left, but with other player

  2) 1 container
  	- Chat window

* Container structures

 	- Markup for player choice content (before move has been selected - show all possible move icons):
 		* Note: "player-active" class for <h2> will make the color orange; for "play-icons" <div>, it will give a background and border to content

	DB name: multi-rps

	Main object: players
		Indexes for players: 
			-1
			-2
		
		DB fields (included inside of each player index):
			-name
			-choice
			-wins
			-losses

	DB Insertion Notes:
		- When a player enters their name, a node is generated (with player number, and within that is "name", "wins: 0", "losses: 0")

		- When a player makes a move selection, the following is updated: 
			* The player's move choice (as a string, i.e. "rock"), and the turn is incremented
			* Note: if first move of current round, the win/loss is not updated
			* As soon as final player goes, the following is updated: 2nd player choice string, win/loss for each player
